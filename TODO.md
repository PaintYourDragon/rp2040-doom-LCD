# TODO 

* remove all TODOs
* make some modifications to the readme:
  * explain what I changed and why
* add targets for the different screens instead of toggling them in cmakefiles
fix saving :(

# Maybe not todo...

* Delete all i2c networking code?
  * meh, it's not hurting anybody
* Get working on https://github.com/01Space/RP2040-0.42LCD ?
  * if I can find it...
* render whole lines via blocking st7789_write
  * this doesn't work, but I'm pretty sure it's because I've flipped the memory 90 degrees and now I have to end on a word or something
